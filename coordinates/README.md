# Coordinate Conventions

This document states conventions for use of coordinates and coordinate
systems at Einride. We should strive towards following these conventions
to facilitate any integration of partner solutions and to avoid bugs
when developing our software.

## Chirality

Use right-hand rule for all measurements and values i.e. before using
our sensor measurements the data should be converted to the right-hand
rule. Read more at [Wikipedia: Right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule).
